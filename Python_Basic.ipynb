        "\n",
        "**1. What is Python, and why is it popular ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and ease of use, making it popular for various applications, including web development, data science, and machine learning. Its popularity stems from its extensive libraries, large community, and ability to be used for a wide range of tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. What is an interpreter in Python ?**\n",
        "- In Python, an interpreter is a program that reads and executes Python code line by line, translating it into machine-readable instructions and then executing them.  \n",
        "\n",
        "**3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?**\n",
        "- Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc.)\n",
        "- E.g. if, else, while, for, def, class, import, try, except, return, True, False, None, etc.\n",
        "- Keywords are case-Sensitive and cannot be redefine and overridden within the same program.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?**\n",
        "- In python, We cannot use the keyword as variable's name. Because, keywords are reserved word in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. What is mutability in Python ?**\n",
        "- In python, Mutability is refers to an object's ability to be changed after it's created.\n",
        "- Mutable object can be modified in place, while immutable object cannot.\n",
        "- E.g. Lists, dictionaries, etc...\n",
        "\n",
        "**6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?**\n",
        "- Lists are mutable, Because we can modify/change the lists.\n",
        "- Tuples are immutable, Because we cannot modify/change the tuples.\n",
        "\n",
        "**7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python  ?**\n",
        "- \"==\" is the **\"equality operator\"**.\n",
        "- This is used to check value equality.\n",
        "- This operater compare between two values.\n",
        "- \"is\" is the **\"Identity operator\"**.\n",
        "- This checks for objects identity.\n",
        "- This operator checks if two variables refers to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "**8. What are logical operators in Python ?**\n",
        "- In python, Logical operators areused on conditional statements (either True or False).\n",
        "- There are three types of logical operator in python :\n",
        "1.   AND operator\n",
        "2.   OR operator\n",
        "3.   NOT operator\n",
        "\n",
        "**9. What are type casting in Python ?**\n",
        "- Type casting, also referred to as type conversion, is the process of changing one data type to another in Python.\n",
        "- Python provides built-in functions for type casting, Like, int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc...\n",
        "- Type casting is often necessary for performing arithmetic operations, data manipulation, and input/output operations in Python programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting ?**\n",
        "\n",
        "  **Implicit Type Casting:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- It occurs automatically when a value of one data type is assigned to a variable of a different, compatible data type.\n",
        "- The compiler handles the conversion without any special syntax or instructions from the programmer.\n",
        "- E.g. int to long, float to double, etc...\n",
        "- Implicit casting is generally safe and does not lead to data loss in most cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Explicit Type Casting:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- Requires the programmer to use a cast operator to explicitly convert a value from one data type to another.\n",
        "- Used when converting to a type that is not automatically convertible, or when the programmer wants to force a conversion that might otherwise be disallowed.\n",
        "- E.g. include converting a floating-point number to an integer (which may lead to data loss), or converting a base class pointer to a derived class pointer.\n",
        "- Explicit casting can potentially lead to data loss or unexpected results if not used carefully.\n",
        "\n",
        "**11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?**\n",
        "- The purpose of conditional statements in python is to enable decision-making, implement branching logic, and control the flow of execution based on specific conditions.\n",
        "\n",
        "**12. How does the elif statement work ?**\n",
        "- The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "**13. What is the difference between for and while loops ?**\n",
        "**for loop:**\n",
        "- It is ideal for iterating over a sequence (like a list, array, or string) where the number of iterations is known in advance.\n",
        "- You can think of it as a structured way to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.\n",
        "- E.g. Printing numbers from 1 to 10.\n",
        "\n",
        "**while loop:**\n",
        "- Used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, and the loop continues as long as a condition remains true.\n",
        "- The loop body is executed repeatedly until the condition becomes false.\n",
        "- E.g. Asking a user for input until they enter a valid value.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**14.Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.**\n",
        "- A 'While Loop' is more appropriate when you need to iterate until a condition is met without knowing the number of iterations in advance.\n",
        "- This makes it suitable for situations like processing user guesses for a secret number."
